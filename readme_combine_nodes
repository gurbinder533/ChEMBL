This program can combine any two labels which have a relationship and make one big node with all relationship from both nodes.
It can be decided if the relationships between this label node should still exist or not after the merging.
Also, the program needs the information which direction the relationship has.
The last argument is optional but add a label to the combined node.

In the program maybe the username (of neo4j) and the password need to change into your's.

This is the example for Target merging
python combine_nodes.py target_dictionary chembl_id_lookup True False Target

In the end you have to use neo4j-shell -file cypher_file.cypher
